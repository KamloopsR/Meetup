## Week 1
In the first session we'll each introduce ourselves around the table, take time to make sure everyone has their environment set up, go through some simple data plotting, and make a plan for week 2.

If possible, please have R and RStudio set up before you arrive. See [Installing R and setting up your environment](https://github.com/KamloopsR/Meetup/blob/master/Resources.md#installing-r-and-setting-up-your-environment) in the page of [resources](https://github.com/KamloopsR/Meetup/blob/master/Resources.md) we've put together.
