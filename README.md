# Kamloops R and code co-learning meetup
This repository is the home for all resources for the Kamloops R Meetup group, an informal group of folk who are interested in learning R together.

Our co-learning adventures started January 10th, 2019 and we've been meeting weekly since then. The scope has broadened to include any like-minded people who want to build up their coding skills by working on projects. A few of us are sticking with R ðŸ™‚.

Communications take place in the #r-meetup channel of the [Built in Kamloops Slack](https://builtinkamloops-slackin.now.sh/) workspace, which is free for anyone to join. ([How to Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members))

## Resources
 Have a look at the [resources list](Resources.md) we curate, including installing R and setting up your environment, getting started with git and GitHub, text analysis, dashboarding etc.

## (History) Week 1. Thursday, January 10
In the first session we'll each introduce ourselves around the table, review our code of conduct, take time to make sure everyone has their environment set up (Stef will demo), read and explore a dataset, and make a plan for week 2.

If possible, please have R and RStudio set up before you arrive. For guidance, see the page of [resources](https://github.com/KamloopsR/Meetup/blob/master/Resources.md) we've put together.
